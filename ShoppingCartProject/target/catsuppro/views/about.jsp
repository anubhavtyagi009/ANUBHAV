         <h2>HISTORY OF RACING</h2></br>
         <p>Until the late 1960s motorcycles came in three basic formats:
Working bikes: Generally below 250 cc (15.3 cu in) and low-powered for commuting and utility travelling.
General bikes: Generally below 500 cc (30.5 cu in) / 650 cc (39.7 cu in) for use as a working bike, but with
a higher power output so it could also be used for fun on the weekends.
Touring bikes: Anything above working/general bike sizes and built mainly for touring.
The first company to crack this mold was arguably Vincent Motorcycles. Designed as a gentleman's touring bike
their model's speed was astounding for days when motorways and freeways didn't exist. However its handling was basic
 and its shortcomings became clear when faced by a motorway - girder forks. By the 1960s bikes were developed which could
 be both daily commuter as well as weekend racer  including the BSA Rocket 3/Triumph Trident.
However it was the introduction in 1969 of the Honda CB750K that initiated the era of the modern sport bike.
The CB750 was the first bike to have an overhead-cam in-line 4 engine and a front disc brake, the bike was acclaimed
as "the most sophisticated production bike ever" by Cycle Magazine .
The Honda CB750 was followed in by the 1971 Kawasaki Z1, with its 900 cc (54.9 cu in) DOHC engine, and this firmly
 established the modern sport bike (or superbike). These bikes sold so well that by the end of that decade the
 Japanese manufacturers were all building competing machines with DOHC inline-4 engine configuration.
  The resulting "bike war" among the Japanese manufacturers and required investment in modern engine manufacturing
  contributed to the demise of the flagging British motorcycle industry.

       <h2>TRANSFORMATION</h2>
       <p>Sport touring motorcycles share many features of sport bikes, but they are generally considered a class
         all their own. These are mid- to large-sized motorcycles that offer more carrying capacity, more relaxed
         ergonomics, and more versatility than specialized sport bikes, while being lighter and more agile than touring
         motorcycles. Some sport bikes are marketed as race replicas, implying that the model sold to the public is
         identical to the one used in racing, or at least is closer to the racing version than non-replica models.
         Suffixes R or RR applied to model codes can be interpreted as standing for replica or race replica.
        </p>
        <p>
          Race Replica was used in the late 1970s UK where 250 cc models customized with full bodykits providing
          race-styling in factory team colors themed to the top-level of sponsored riders of the time were available
          marketed towards 'learner' riders who had not passed a driving test enabling their progression to
          large-capacity machines.In 1982 Yamaha described their 1983 RD350 YPVS launched at the Cologne
          motorcycle show as "the nearest thing to a road going racer ever produced".
        </p>
        <p>
          The term race replica was then also used to distinguish the period of sport bike production from
          Japan and Europe since the mid-1980s having integrated race-styled bodywork, representing an evolution
          from the superbike period that began in 1969. The sport bike, or race replica, era began with the 1983
          Suzuki RG250 Gamma, the 1984 Honda VF750F and the 1985 Suzuki GSX-R750, and had full fairings. Sport
           bikes with small or no fairings have proliferated since the mid-1990s. These are called naked bikes or
           streetfighters,and they retain many of the performance features of other sport bikes, but besides
           abbreviated bodywork, they give the rider a more upright posture by using, for example, higher handlebars
            of clip ons. The streetfighter name, associated with motorcycle stunt riding and perhaps hooliganism on
            public roads, can imply higher performance than the sometimes more tame naked bike, which in some cases
            is a synonym for a standard motorcycle. Others define naked bikes as equal in power and performance
            to sport bikes, merely absent the bodywork.

     <h2>CLASSIFICATION</h2>
    <p>
      There is no universal authority defining the terminology of sport bikes or any other motorcycle classes.
       Legal definitions are limited by local jurisdiction, and race sanctioning bodies like the American Motorcyclist
        Association (AMA) and the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) set rules that only apply to those who
         choose to participate in their competitions. Nonetheless, by present day standards in Europe, North America
          and the rest of the developed world, sport bikes are usually divided into three, four, or five rough
          categories, reflecting vaguely similar engine displacement, horsepower, price and intended use, with a
           good measure of subjective opinion and simplification. Marketing messages about a model from the manufacturer
            can diverge from the consensus of the motorcycling media and the public. Sometimes the classes used in
            motorcycle racing are approximated in production models, often but not always in connection with homologation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sport bike classes in common usage are:</br>

Lightweight: also called entry level, small or beginner bikes. Some two strokes in this class have dramatically
 higher performance than the four strokes, being likened to miniature superbikes.Sport bikes with engine displacements
  of up to about 500 cc (31 cu in) are usually in this class.</br></br>

Middleweight: mid-sized, mid-level or supersport. Some of the models in this range qualify for racing in the classes
 AMA Supersport Championship, British Supersport Championship and the Supersport World Championship, but many
  middleweights do not have a significant presence in racing. Displacements of 600–750 cc (37–46 cu in) are typical.</br></br>
Superbike: liter-class or literbike i.e. 1,000 cc (61 cu in).As with supersport, many of the models in this class
compete in superbike racing.</br></br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Open class, hypersport or hyperbike are terms sometimes used in lieu of superbike as a catch-all for
        everything larger than middleweight.Alternatively, these terms mark a class above the superbikes for the
        largest displacement sport bikes with the highest top speeds, with weights somewhat greater than the superbike
        class. Hyperbike was in use by 1979.
